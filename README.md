# restcontroller
A simple test task for developing a REST API on Spring Boot.

Test task.

Design (think over the format and limitations of incoming/outgoing parameters) and implement a REST API that calculates the frequency of characters meeting on a given string.
The result should be sorted in descending order of the number of occurrences of the character in the specified string.

Example input string: “aaaaabcccc”
Example output result: “a": 5, “c“: 4, ”b": 1
